a. State and explain De Morgan's Law for Boolean Algebra

Theorem 1: Let B = (S, ∨, ∧, ٰ , O, I) be a Boolean algebra. De Morgan's Laws hold ∀x, y ∈ S.

```{Demorgans laws}
De Morgan’s laws : 
(x ∨ y)' = x' ∧ y' , --  Statement 1
(x ∧ y)' = x' ∨ y'., --  Statement 2
```
De Morgan's Laws for Boolean Algebra states that the following 
The negation of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations of the propositions; 
and the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations of the propositions;



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
